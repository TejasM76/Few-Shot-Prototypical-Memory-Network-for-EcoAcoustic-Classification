# Few-Shot-Prototypical-Memory-Network-for-EcoAcoustic-Classification
A framework for Few-Shot Learning in audio classification, designed for eco-acoustic and bioacoustic tasks. It supports episodic dataset generation, efficient preprocessing, and robust augmentation. Ideal for species identification and soundscape analysis with minimal labeled data, using datasets like BirdCLEF.
