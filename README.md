# Few-Shot-Prototypical-Memory-Network-for-EcoAcoustic-Classification
The Few-Shot Audio Classification Framework is a robust solution designed for Few-Shot Learning (FSL) in audio classification, particularly in eco-acoustic and bioacoustic applications. It enables efficient classification with minimal labeled data by leveraging episodic learning, memory-augmented modules, and advanced neural architectures. This framework is ideal for tasks such as species identification, soundscape analysis, and biodiversity monitoring. Key features include dynamic dataset generation for n-way, k-shot episodic learning, advanced audio preprocessing (e.g., Mel spectrogram conversion and resampling), and robust data augmentation through time and frequency masking. The framework also incorporates memory-augmented learning, allowing the model to store and recall class information dynamically, making it suitable for long-tail and noisy datasets. With scalable processing capabilities, GPU acceleration, and tools for dataset validation and visualization (e.g., t-SNE plots and confusion matrices), this framework simplifies real-world applications like species tracking and ecosystem health assessment.

The primary dataset used is the BirdCLEF 2024 Dataset, which contains audio recordings of bird vocalizations. Users can easily set up the dataset, modify configurations, and run scripts to generate episodic datasets, validate them, train models, and evaluate performance. The frameworkâ€™s modular design supports future enhancements, such as integrating self-supervised learning techniques, expanding dataset compatibility, and implementing advanced augmentation methods.
